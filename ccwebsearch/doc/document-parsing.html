<p>
Parsing a document obtained from the web will involve three steps (as explained in the <a href="high-level-design.html#document_parsing">high-level documentation</a>):
<ul>
<li> extract well-formed RDF
<li> parse the well-formed RDF into specific fields
<li> produce a stripped-down version of the HTML content
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Extracting Well-Formed RDF</h3>

<p>
Work already done by Nathan Yergler on <a
href="http://www.yergler.net/averages/archives/ccvalidator">ccValidator</a>
will be helpful here to extract RDF from web documents. In fact,
Nathan's "support" code will be refactored into a set of generic
Python procedures to fetch a URL and extract any contained RDF in a
thread-safe manner.
</p>

<p>
It will be important to make this <tt>fetch-url-and-extract-rdf</tt>
procedure as generic as possible, so that we may later extend it to
use new W3C-recommended methods of finding associated RDF.
</p>

<h3>Parse the RDF</h3>

<p>
Once again, the work done by Nathan Yergler on <a
href="http://www.yergler.net/averages/archives/ccvalidator">ccValidator</a>
will be helpful in processing the RDF. Specifically, the
<tt>ccLicense</tt> Python class will be used to model the licensed
work from its RDF representation. If improvements are needed, they
will be made in cooperation with Nathan. Some additions are likely to
be necessary in order to model the <tt>rdf:work</tt> section of the RDF.
</p>

<p>
<tt>ccValidator</tt> requires the use of <a href="http://rdflib.net">rdflib</a> and <a href="">Aaron
Shwartz's RDF TRAMP</a>, both of which are simple to install and use
on a Python platform.
</p>

<h3>Produce Stripped-Down HTML</h3>

<p>
In addition to parsing the RDF, we want to extract the raw text from
the HTML page in order to have more searchable content per indexed
item. This will mostly involve stripping out all HTML tags and
comments, leaving only the text that is visible to the user.
</p>

<p>
We will begin by using the standard Python SGML parser, which allows
us to quickly discard all HTML tags and keep just the content. The
advantage of using this generic SGML parser is that we can eventually
choose to process certain tags more importantly than others
(<tt>H2</tt> is likely more important than non-headlined text),
without too much additional effort.
</p>

<p>
Thus, we will use <tt>sgmllib.SGMLParser</tt>.
