<p>
We have a prototype search engine that:
<ul>
<li> gathers URLs from AllTheWeb
<li> provides an easy-to-extend URL gathering API
<li> uses gathered URLs to download documents, check RDF, and index the content
<li> searches by license property and full text
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We can now pursue development of this search engine with a few
efforts, most of which can be done in parallel.
</p>

<h3>More URL Gathering</h3>
<p>
Searching through more URLs is better. We can increase the number of URLs we gather by:
<ul>
<li> playing tricks on AllTheWeb and Google
<li> writing our own crawler or using an existing one
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Automation and Production Deployment</h3>
<p>
The current system can be automated by using simple cron scripts, but
this automation must be thoroughly tested. One goal would be to make
this system totally automated and fully-tested, with error-reporting
via email when something goes wrong.
</p>

<h3>Tuning the Search Application</h3>
<p>
As we gather more pages to index, we may want to tune how we index
various pieces of the page to provide better searching capabilities,
advanced searching capabilities (by author), etc..
</p>

<h3>Load-Testing the Search</h3>
<p>
This is crucial before we deploy at any level. It's also the most
complicated aspect of the whole thing. The search is
different from the rest of the CC site in that:
<ul>
<li> it provides an active, dynamic service
<li> it will get significant usage, increasing with time
<li> it will require significant hardware resources, much more so than
anything else the CC site currently does.
</ul>

Things to do (migrated from todo.txt)
============

- Be able to check how many URLs are returned by a particular search engine
(specifically by signalling done in a particular category when past the end)

- check if long URLs are truncated by alltheweb

- Return a 1 or 0 from insert_url plpgsql proc depending on whether insert happened or not

- Find a way to make sure that multiple gatherers with same goals aren't created

- add time awareness

- Fixing other things:
  - max length on title (250)

- maybe add the new subject to the list of URLs to check?
