<h3>Tool</h3>

<p>
We will use <a
href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/">tsearch2</a>
for full-text indexing within PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p>
We need a comprehensive system for full-text indexing of documents,
efficiently updating the indexes, and relatively efficient
searching. Our goal is not to scale this system significantly at this
time. Thus, we choose an architecture that, while most likely
scalable, is focused mostly on simple, flexible full-text indexing.
</p>

<p>
<b>tsearch2</b> is a very good candidate because it:
<ul>
<li> performs full-text indexing within the database, greatly
simplifying maintenance
<li> is being adopted as a contrib package in PostgreSQL v7.4, thus
showing significant promise of adoption
<li> is extensible via standard ispell packages for stemming
<li> is flexible in how it indexes various sections of text with
appropriate weights
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Specifics</h3>

<p>
<b>tsearch2</b> is installed as an add-on module for PostgreSQL 7.3 or
7.4. Thus, even if we choose to stick with PostgreSQL 7.3, we can use
it safely.
</p>

<p>
We note one complication because of tsearch2 usage: <b><u>backups</u></b>. We
will need to develop and test backup scripts. Since the search data
can (and should) be regenerated every week or two, backups are not a
primary problem. However, once this system goes into production, we
won't want 1-2 weeks of downtime. Thus, we need to develop a plan for
tsearch2 backups, even if this plan is not top priority.
</p>

<p>
We want to set up the tsearch2 indexes in such a way that we can easily
tweak the weights of various components to yield more relevant search
results. This will be especially useful during development. Thus, we
will <b><u>keep the processed URLs around</u></b> for reindexing
purposes.
</p>

<p>
Since <tt>tsearch2</tt> uses database triggers to maintain full-text
indexes, we can simply <b><u>use the normal Python-to-PG interface</u></b>
(<tt>psycopg</tt>) to store the processed RDF and stripped HTML. The
triggers will do the rest automatically.
