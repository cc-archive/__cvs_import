<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
We have a few technology requirements:
<ul>
<li> <b>High-Level and Rapid Development</b>: the requirements will change rapidly and we want to be able to adapt the code quickly.
<li> <b>Integration</b>: as much as possible, code produced should be easy to integrate with other relevant code developed for/by Creative Commons.
<li> <b>Maintenance</b>: easy to maintain given existing Creative
Commons technology investments.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>. We will likely use
PostgreSQL 7.4 for this development. If 7.4 turns out to be unstable
in development, we will revert to 7.3.4.
</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://python.org">Python 2.3</a>, with
specific add-on modules for:
<ul>
<li> threading
<li> RDF/XML parsing
<li> database connectivity: <tt>psycopg</tt>
</ul>
</p>
