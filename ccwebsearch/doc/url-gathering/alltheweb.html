<h3>General Strategy</h3>
<p>
AllTheWeb doesn't offer SOAP APIs at this point. Thus, we need to
actually request HTML pages and parse them. I have put a request in
with AllTheWeb to see when they may launch SOAP APIs, as this would be
a far better way of going about the process of URL gathering.
</p>

<h3>Request Format</h3>
<p>
Using AllTheWeb's web search form, we can find all the CreativeCommons
URLs with a single search query of the form:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>link:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/</tt>
</blockquote>


<p>
There is no need to query license by license, which keeps the
interface to the URL gathering module quite simple. The URL at
AllTheWeb for executing this query is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>http://alltheweb.com/search?q=[search_query]</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
where <tt>[search_query]</tt> is the search query mentioned above,
URL-encoded if need be.
</p>

<p>
We note that to get results in larger sets, we need to have a cookie
set for 100 results at a time. Since there are also other cookie
parameters, we will need to check if this can be automated. In the
worst case, we can simply automate the getting and setting of a cookie
before a search begins.
</p>

<h3>Results Format</h3>
<p>
AllTheWeb results are fairly intricate chunks of HTML, but all of the
URLs are found in:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>&lt;span class="resURL"&gt;http://foo.com&lt;/span&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This also includes sponsored links, which at some point we may have to
parse out, but at this point doesn't seem like an issue for backlink
searches (I doubt sponsored links can be added for backlink searches).
