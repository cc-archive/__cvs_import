0.1.1

Replaced mod_ptyhon/spyce/cheetah frontend with PHP.  Introduced
lineurlgatherer.py.  Documentation not completely updated (in particular
less emphasis should be placed on gathering URLs through search engine
queries).  Ugly code by Mike Linksvayer.  Graceful CSS frontend design
by Matt Haughey.
