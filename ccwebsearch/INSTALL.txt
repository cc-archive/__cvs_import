WHAT YOU NEED
=============

- Python 2.3
- PostgreSQL 7.4
- PHP 4.x with PosgreSQL support

ARCHITECTURE DETAILS
====================

There are two main components to the RDF Search system:
      A) the asynchronous Spider
      B) the web interface

Component A requires Python, PostgreSQL, and the rdf-search code.

Component B requires PHP, but could well be implemented using
AOLserver/Tcl, JSP, etc... within a few days.

The only link between components A and B is the PostgreSQL database.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

COMPONENT A: The Spider
-----------------------

1) Install Python 2.3, Psycopg, and PostgreSQL 7.4 (including tsearch2)

2) Create a database in PG called "cc"

3) Run the AllTheWeb URL Gatherer in crawler/alltheweb.py

4) Run the Document Gatherer in crawler/documentgatherer.py
with command line argument the # of running threads. Multi-threading
is not working as well as I'd like, so use a low number like 1, 2, or
3.  Alternatively create a file with one URL per line and run
crawler/lineurlgatherer.py with the file as the sole argument.


(Repeat 3 and 4 using cron jobs every week or so)


COMPONENT B: The Search Interface
---------------------------------

1) Set up PHP with Postgresql support.

2) Put the www/ directory of this installation tarball in your
   webroot, or any subdirectory (all links are relative).
