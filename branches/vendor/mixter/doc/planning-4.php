Creative Commons is going to be responsible for supplying the magnet content for our site. They have a number of contacts in the music industry, and our contact is going to speak with several musician/teacher types about writing articles. Our contact at Creative Commons (Neeru) is going to get back to us by September 26th with a rough summary of who will be writing content, and what they will be writing.
