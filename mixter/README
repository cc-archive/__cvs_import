README for Mixter application

Global server-related configuration variables are in
modules/mod-utilities/globals.

Our Apache2 configuration files are in the apache/ directory, just
for reference.

The FILE_ORGANIZATION file describes what kinds of files are in each
directory.

There needs to be a content directory somewhere on the server (specified
in globals) for the application to store uploaded content.
