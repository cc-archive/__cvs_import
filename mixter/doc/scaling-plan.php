<H2>Scaling Plan</H2>
Our scaling plan is divided into three phases.
<BR><BR>
Phase One:
<BR><BR>
Each user will have a page listing all of their contributions to the site, any biographical information the user chooses to make available, and how long the user has been a member of the site.  This page will be available at the url {site_root}/user?name=$username.  Any occurrence of a username in the site (such as where he has authored content) will be a hyperlink to this page.  This is designed to induce user accountability and identifiability.
<BR><BR>
Phase Two:
<BR><BR>
Users can create "Group Pages" that are intended to correspond to a band or some other sort of musical collaboration group.  Users can ask group leaders to become part of the group, at which point they'll have access to group-specific discussion groups and online music versioning tools.  Their group pages will be linked to the individual pages of the group members, and will link to all their members' musical content.
<BR><BR>
Phase Three:
<BR><BR>
Musical trails will be created between artists when one user "samples" another artist's work.  A connection will then be created between the two indicated that this has happened.  Then users can see who has sampled whose work, and perhaps find new artists they would enjoy.  It'll also induce accountability to artists to provide something new and original based off of old work.
<BR><BR>
Geospatialization will occur through region-specific discussion forums.  The "regional view" of a discussion group will include all of the normal general-view groups' content, but will also have flagged posts that apply only to that certain region.  When a user makes a post, he can flag it as "region-specific".  New replies to region-specific posts will automatically be flagged as region-specific.  Regional content will be organized by groups of zip codes.
