Looking up a user by email address will be very efficient, since we create 
an index on email address.  Our email address search is case-insensitive.

To determine if a certain user is a member of a certain group, we need only
examine either as many rows as users in the group or as many rows as the 
user has groups, since we index on user and group in the user-group mapping
table.
