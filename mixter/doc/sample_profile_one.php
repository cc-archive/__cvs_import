<h2>Mixter User Profile 1: Garrett Thompson</h2>

<IMG SRC="./alan-sam.jpg">

<ul>

<li>Name:  Garrett Thompson

<li>Age:  43, married

<li>Address: Denver Colorado

<li>Occupation: Private orthodontist practice.

<li>Income: $153,000

<li>Music Experience:  Garrett has no music experience, other than that he likes to listen to music. He likes soft rock, especially 80s bands like The Alan Parsons Project.

<li>Short-term Goal:  Garrett wants to download music to listen to.

<li>Long-term Goal:  Garrett's orthodontist practice currently pays a decent fee for commercial-free elevator music to play in the waiting areas. Garrett likes having this music playing, but would like to stop paying for it, and wants to find enough free music online to use. He would like to find enough mp3s licenses in such a way that he can just download them and replay them, so that he can stop paying for the elevator music.

<li>Immediate Questions:  What soft rock is available on Mixter? How can I find artists with similar tastes as The Alan Parsons Project?

<li>Other Interests:  Sailing, Golfing

<li>Computer:  Both a laptop and a recent desktop, decently fast, and with cable modem as well as wireless in his house. Has two cellphones and a pager he plays with frequently.

<li>Experience with information technology: Garrett has lots of gadgets and likes to play with his computer equipment, but isn't too savvy. Consequently, he has a thousand applications running on his taskbar and his computer is much slower than it ought to be. Nevertheless, it is still pretty powerful, and plenty fast for surfing the web.

<h2><A NAME="usage">Sample Usage Scenario</h2>
Garrett gets on Mixter and searches for "80s rock." He finds several artists who seemed to like that, and downloads their music. He likes some of it, and downloads the rest of their music. He also clicks on the links on their page to other Mixter artists, and checks out their music. He does this for several hours and downloads about sixty songs, which stay on his computer, and he listens to. He goes to the Forums and under "Publishing," posts a message, describing his desire to get rid of the elevator music, and if anyone can tell him what the legal and technical issues with doing so are. After finding there aren't particularly any, he continues to download more music, and also emails several of the artists telling them he likes their music and would love it if they made more songs like X, Y, and Z.
