<h2><A NAME="usage">Sample Usage Scenario</h2>
Mark forms a group for his band its members and posts a message in the "Looking for Artists" forum, telling other artists about his desire for a crossover jazz/rock song on their album, and asking interested artists to request to join his group. Mark comes back the next day and sees that three saxophone players, indepent of each other, have requested to join his group. He approves them, and posts a preliminary version of the song his rock band has put together. He talks for a while with each of the artists, and eventually they come up with a three part jazz saxophone line, and the saxophone players each record their parts. Using some careful mixing Mark combines all three tracks and posts the resulting track to the group. The different artists discuss the track, propose some small changes, which are made, and the part is rerecorded. Then the part is merged with the part the rock band has been working on, and the final track is published as the Group's first track. Users start downloading it, and "The Slackers" publish that song as a promo for their new album.
