Here's some of our comments for your site:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>simple site, maybe some more work can be done on the design - though
I know you mentioned that another person was in charge of designing.
<LI>
site navigation links, can be grouped.  i.e. there can be an
articles section, a news section, etc. instead of add an article, view
recent articles, add a news item, view recent news, etc.
<LI>
It is difficult to navigate from page to page without going 
back to the Main page. 
<LI>
Titles of all pages are "Mixter".  This makes navigating 
through the back button a challenging task.
<LI>
small note: maybe more indentation for reply message, a little more
spaces would make threading more apparent.
<LI>
liked the View By : thread, date, submitted, feature. 
<LI>
instead of having a "back" button when you view a forum posting, you
might consider having some kind of navigation bar -- like Home &gt;
Forums &gt; 6.171 Discussion &gt;...
<LI>
a consistent header throughout all the pages would help - like
"Mixer" logo or something on each page.  menu options available on all
pages would be nice too.
<LI>
overall, good site.  seems like the functionality is mostly there,
some more work ondesign needs to be done, but maybe you guys are
waiting for your client's designer.

During user registration, you may want to make state a pulldown menu, and 
integrate  it with city and zip code, using the handy-dandy USPS tools "for 
integrating ZIP Code  Lookup capabilities into your web site or application 
system", available at:<BR><BR>

<LI>
logging in automatically after registering would be nice- especially since 
you go to  all the bother of slipping the username into the form.
<LI>
Your homepage is a little... unaesthetic- perhaps you want to put some 
nav-bars in or  otherwise disrupt the centered list structure?
<LI>
The forum is sweet.  Clean, working implementation!  And it avoids html 
traps ;).
<LI>
When you submit an article, it would be nice to get a little notice like 
"waiting  approval" so that the user knows it won't be immediately available.
<LI>
Oh, and, of course this is between you guys, but why is Matthew the mailto 
on every  page?
<LI>
Generally this is a really neatly laid out site- well organized.  It's 
lacking only a  few bug-fixes and a nice nav-bar to make it really usable.

It's not clear what the site is for. Maybe include some text that 
explains its purpose and why one should sign up and use the service.
<LI>
Error messages when creating a new user account appear at the top 
rather than next to the field causing the error. Also, multiple invalid 
fields elicit a single error message at a time. It would take less 
clicks for someone who sucks at typing to submit once, see all his 
mistakes, and change them all at once.
<LI>
For state and country fields, it would be easier to gather 
information about your users if there were a set list of states and 
countries to choose from so people are not using different names to 
refer to the same places.
<LI>
It would look better if the fields had lengths appropriate to 
their content when signing up for an account. eg, zip codes are never 
that long.
<LI>
Logging in as admin should probably take you directly to the 
admin home instead of requiring an extra click.
<LI>
Navigation would be better if it was more contextual. eg, on the 
admin page there could be a single page called new submissions which 
allows you to link to recently submitted articles, news, and music. 
These pages could then allow you to approve or reject the submissions. 
Similarly, the admin page could have a page to manage users.
<LI>
Instead of having separate pages for adding an article and 
viewing recent articles, adding news items and viewing news items, 
adding music and viewing recent music, you could have news displayed on 
the home page with links to articles and music where you can then submit 
that type of content.
<LI>	
It would be nice to have a way to approve and delete posts 
without having to click on each one, one at a time.
<LI>
It would be better if everything was not centered.

The page appearance is still a little hard on the eyes. 
<LI>
The Navigation is typically at the top of a page
and having everything centered instead of aligned seems a little 
unconventional. Also, right now the depth of your links
is 1 since everything links back to te home page, but if this were to 
change as you restructured your page it may be a little
tougher to navigate to intermediate pages between the home page and 
the current page if you are a few levels deep. Again, a
navbar at the top would help things out. 
<LI>
Overall, content submission seems very easy and straightforward. it also appears
that you have a fair amount of content to give the lived-in look. 
<LI>
The look 
and feel will be greatly improved with some color, a
consistent header, and better arrangement, but I believe you 
mentioned that your client was paying someone else to
work on the appearance. 
<LI>
Account creation was simple. I liked that after I 
created my account it entered my username in
automatically. This assumes that I am going to want to log in right away 
which is probably a good assumption but if that is the
case it would be better to simply log me in immediately after my account is 
created.

Page Flow: on the parts of the site that are meant to be mixter itself,
navigation is ok/consistent, the documentation section of their site
doesn't use some sort 
of header pointing back to the rest of the site.
<LI> 
 Look, Feel, Navigation: as seen in class, lots of funny-looking
 centering going on, left-justification seems like a good idea. Simple is
 good, but perhaps just a touch more visual effects than just plain black
 and white with the occasional purple form might be nice. Different parts
 of a page could be delineated better, place the footer below an &lt;hr&gt;,
 etc.
<LI>
 Version Control and Audit Trail: not really clear whether content
 versioning is going on, as an admin, I could approve or reject an
 article but not modify it, so I'm not really sure what the status of an
 item would be if it could be modified.
<LI>
 Attachments: Music can be uploaded, tested it by uploading a file
 downloaded from the site. One bug I noticed is that any new file
 uploaded is listed twice in the
 view recent music page.   
<LI>
 Categorization and Presentation Hints: see look and feel comments about
 widget delineation.
