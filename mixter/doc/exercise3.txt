Someone sniffing packets can learn our user's password.  We plan on stopping
that by implementing SSL for password transactions.

Someone sniffing packets could possibly gain access to the site under false
credentials if they spoof PHP session cookies, which is something I'm going to
try and do this weekend.

A user who forgets his password can get an e-mail reminder.
