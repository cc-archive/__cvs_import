Page flow is very straight forward and simple. All the ways you'd want to navigate between pages exist. The main screen which just lists the forums seems a little awkward - especially since users can create their own forums without needing to be an administrator, the list of forums is probably going to get rather long, and so the 'create a new forum" and subsequent links will all end up "below the fold so to speak. I like the simple color scheme. No way to upload files, or associate pictures with my profile. No way to make a profile. It seems like it ought to be a little harder to create a forum than simply clicking "Submit Query" over and over on the main page, which will create forums without names or descriptions over and over. With this way of creating forums it seems like there will be a huge number of forums, each with very little content, and the presentation/organization is rather halphazard. You may want to limit forum creation to administrators, or force administrators to approve it in some way. There isn't much in the way of content; I didn't see any community except for the message boards - what if someone has an article explaining how to write some software for the Pens, or wants to post something longer, and less time sensitive than a message board post? Extremely easy and straightforward. No way to sort the forums by thread or date, or recently submitted or anything.

When I tried to register, I put in my last name, first name, email address, and password (which is only specified once - should be twice!) and the application gave me an error. (I think because I already had an account, but it should have told me this, not generated an error)<BR><BR>
After I requested my lost password, I put that in and it took me to the "create community" page. I typed in a community name (Matt's Community), and a URL (http://mattdrake.mit.edu) and left Main Message and Contact Info as defaults, and when I clicked submit I got a "Server Error in '/CoachCom' Application" page and it crashed. I have emailed them and asked them to email me back when their information is accessible.

- Forums didn't seem to be working
- Article submission is straightforward, although I didn't understand the "filename" field. Perhaps you want to document this. In general you might want to include more documentation for users clicking around on your site, to let them know how the content submission works. Also I couldn't figure out how to add new sections to the documentation - is this hardcoded?
- The actual page that you submit content on is kind of ugly - in particular, the "textareas" that you fill the main content areas with are extremely large - you might want to shrink these, because in these the user can scroll in the window; the entire article doesn't have to be visible on screen at once. Also, you may want to explain more what filename and "description" mean.
