<FONT SIZE="5">Content Workflow:</FONT><BR><BR>
<B>Workflow for News/Articles</B>:
<UL>
 <LI>Any user can write content and submit it.
 <LI>Any administrator can approve or reject content
 <LI>If content is rejected it is emailed back to the author along with the rejection notice.
 <LI>If content is approved, an approval message is sent to the author
 <LI>Any user can see approved news
 <LI>At any time a user can submit a new version of an article. This gets approved/rejected in the
 same manner as the previous version. If it gets approved, the "visible" version of the article
 to users is the latest approved copy.
</UL>
<B>Workflow for Comments</B>:<BR>
This may be modified to be more like the forums -- that is, submitted comments
default to approved status unless rejected by an admistrator.  Downsides of this
approach include less intelligent and focused comments, but on the other hand,
it promotes discussion of news articles and new magnet content as it is 
released.  Changes may be made after next consultation with our client.
<UL>
 <LI>Any user can write a comment and submit it.
 <LI>Any administrator can approve or reject a comment.
 <LI>If a comment is rejected it is emailed back to the author along with the rejection notice
 <LI>If a comment is approved, an approval message is sent to the author
 <LI>Any user can see approved comments by viewing the article or news they are associated with.
</UL>
<B>Workflow for Forums</B>:
<UL>
 <LI>Any administrator can create forums. A public and private forum is automatically created 
 for each group.
 <LI>Any user can see/post in public forums. 
 <LI>Any group member can see/post in private forums of which he is a member.
 <LI>When a posting is submitted, it goes to "submitted" status
 <LI>The posts that users can see are those that have been "submitted" or "approved"
 <LI>Administrators can change a postings status. In particular there will be an interface
 that loops over all submitted posts, and lets moderators specify them as approved or rejected.
 If a posting gets "rejected" the user gets an email notifying him of rejection.
(This system has the benefit that people can post quickly and efficiently, but it encourages
 administrators to still check over all posts for content)
</UL>
<B>Workflow for Music</B>:<BR>
In the music workflow, like in the forums, content immediately goes live.  It 
can later be rejected by an administrator (we anticipate this being primarily
to keep content the artist doesn't have rights to post off the site).  
<UL>
 <LI>An artist uploads a song to his personal space, and marks it as public or private.
 If he used any other works in his mixing, he can specify these at this stage.
 <LI>Any users can see and download songs, based on the creative commons licenses.
 <LI>An artist can delete any file he has uploaded.
 <LI>Any administrator can reject a piece of music, which changes the content's
 status to 'rejected' and sends an e-mail notification to the author.
 <LI>A group member can upload a song to a group space, as a private file.
 <LI>Group members can download private songs in the group and modify them, or post
 revision versions.
 <LI>Any group member can delete any group file, or change any group file from private to public
 (presumably the final version of a song would get marked as public, and after a while the
  rough versions would get deleted)
 <LI>Any user can see any public group files.
 <LI>Any user can download any public group file.
