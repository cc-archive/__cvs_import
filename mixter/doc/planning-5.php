The actual hostname has not been decided yet, although mixter.com is a possibility as it is for sale. Right now creative commons is leaning towards making it a subdomain, i.e. mixter.creativecommons.org. The final decision has yet to be made by their CTO however, and in either case, their IT department is going to handle buying/allocating the IP/hostname.
