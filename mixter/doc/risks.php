Matthew Drake and Ian Spivey - Team &amp;nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="5">Risks</FONT><BR><BR>
Risk: One of us drops the class (low chance/really bad if it happens)<BR>
Preventive Measure: Ian and I are fraternity brothers and have roomed together twice. We are also hardcore. This isn't a risk for us.<BR>
Update: I'm pretty sure this won't happen, because we are pretty sure we are hardcore, and although this class is a ton of work, we seem to have been managing it so far.<BR>
<BR>
Risk: Our development server crashes (low chance, not bad if it happens)<BR>
Preventive Measure: Weekly backups to either Matt or Ian's other computer. Ian's computer is setup virtually identically to Papillion.mit.edu and we are both experienced system administrators, so our downtime would be short and we can move our development environment while we repair the old one.<BR>
Update: Yeah, we do the backups.<BR>
<BR>
Risk: Getting behind (medium chance, bad if it happens)<BR>
Preventive Measure: Make sure Matt is in charge of meeting deadlines. Between Matt's anal-retentive desire to work ahead and Ian's ability to stay up all night working at the last minute, we can get stuff done.<BR>
Update: This has been a tricky one to measure; at any given point we are working on correcting bugs and making our code optimal, and trying to get the next problem set done. Also, the problem sets are vague enough that sometimes we code something which, apparently, we weren't supposed to do yet. (i.e., we already built our discussion system code which isn't do yet, for the content management chapter) I think we are fine though, because we have managed to get everything done from the problem sets, and our "todo" list doesn't really change in length much. (i.e. we take stuff off as fast as it goes on)<BR>
