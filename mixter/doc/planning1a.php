Users will come to our site looking for information related to music creation, and for collaborators for joint music project. They will also use the collaboration tools on our site to work on their music projects.

Here is our statement of purpose which we worked out with our client, which gives more information about how users will use our site:<BR><BR>
Mixter will be an online community for musician collaboration. It will resemble Friendster in that each user will have a profile and can be linked to other users by musical interests, genres, or instrument. Musicians can download each others music and use them in their own pieces. Musicians can also see who is accessing their music, and who has created derivative works of music. Musicians can also create an online "collaboration space," which will let musicians work together to produce pieces of music. This collaboration space will consist of ways to communicate about parts of music as well as store and organize audio files. Finally, there will be forums for artists to trade information, ask and answer questions, and comment on each others work.<BR><BR>
Mixter is being developed for Creative Commons, which will use this both as a demonstration and a product in its own right of the power of online collaboration tools. Music uploaded and downloaded from Mixter will fall under one of several Creative Commons licensing structures which encourage the free trade of music while maintaining artist right and interests.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">User Responses</FONT><BR>
After visiting our site there are a few things we want our users to say. First, we want our users to tell their friends and listeners about the site, so that they can come and download the artists music. Secondly, we want artists to spread the word that they use this site to develop music, and encourage other artists to use it as well. We also want people to see it as a useful community for information about music - after people have visited the site we want to bring them back and encourage them to get more involved.

<FONT SIZE="4">User Classes</FONT><BR>
(Note that some people may fall into more than one class)<BR>
<UL>
 <LI><B>The Listener</B> - Listeners browse the site, looking for music to download. They can browse through artists directories, search by categories, instrument, or artist name, and follow links from one musician to other similar musicians. Their main desire is to find music to listen to, and then download it to their own computer. For them, the site will function similarly to mp3.com.
 <LI><B>The Artist</B> - Artists wish to create music, and will probably register accounts on the site. They will get their own home directory, storage space, and user profile page. They will use this space to upload their work and publish it for other people to see. They will also take advantage of our "collaboration space," tools, that will allow users to track their works as other derivative works are created, and work with other users seperated in place/time, to create works of music online.
 <LI><B>The Group Artist</B> - (This is somewhat just a subtype of artist, but since it will be a big part of our system...) Groups are the mechanism by which artists can collaborate online. Members of the group will be able to upload audio files into a "collaboration space" where any member of the group can access the file. There will be some sort of "versioning system" in place so that users can specify how one file relates to another. (i.e. it is a higher quality rerecorded version of the song, or it is one of several possible guitar solos, etc) Groups can eventually publish songs, which can then be accessed and downloaded the same way artist content can be. 
 <LI><B>The Teachers and Students</B> - Many people will just be curious about music production, music creation, and music in general. They can browse our magnet content and also participate in the forums where they can ask or answer questions from other users.
 <LI><B>Site Administrators</B> - These are the people who will ensure the smooth day-to-day operation of the site for the other user classes.

<FONT SIZE="4">Mobile Users</FONT><BR>
It doesn't seem likely that too many users will want to use our software "on the go," but some functionality might be useful. In particular, user profile pages and geographical searches might be nice, if you wanted to find someone in a certain area. Also, the forums could be useful, simply because they will contain a lot of data useful to aspiring musicians - a user might be in a guitar store picking out a guitar, or might be looking for a concert venue, and rememember a posting he saw online regarding that topic. So we will make those accessible to mobile users. <BR><BR>
Mixing Voice and WAP interaction will probably not be that useful for us. Much of what the user would be doing from the phone is simply navigating our site and then viewing short output results, and for navigating a touch-pad seems easier to use than having to say the commands. Nevertheless we will probably try to enable both interfaces so that it is up to the user.
