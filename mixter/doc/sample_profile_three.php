<h2><A NAME="usage">Sample Usage Scenario</h2>
Rod posts his questions to the Mixter forums, and recieves responses; not only should he take lessons, but there is a teacher in his area. He begins taking lessons, and also posts more drum related questions. He interests his guitar playing friends in Mixter, and they form a group. They use their collaboration space as a place for each member to upload random guitar riffs, cool sounds, or sound effects, where they can download each others, and go to as a source for ideas when they need a guitar solo for a song, or whatnot. Rod eventually gets good enough on drums to join them, and they begin playing locally. Since they're just doing it for fun, they post their songs on Mixter for other users to download at no cost.
