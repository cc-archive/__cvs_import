<P>
Each site critique follows this pattern:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">Site</FONT><BR>
<UL>
<LI>How many clicks to post a message, assuming an already-logged-in user?
<LI>How many clicks to get from the top-level forum page to a thread?
<LI>How many clicks to view the full text of twenty postings in a thread?
<LI>How many clicks to view the subject of all archived posts in a category?
</UL>
<P>
Good user interface and customer service features.
<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">Shacknews.com</FONT><BR>
<UL>
<LI>2
<LI>1 -- "top-level forum page" is news, and there's one thread per news item.
<LI>20 in dthread mode (the default), 0 in flat-mode.
<LI>2 -- but there are no categories, just plaintext search
</UL>
<P>
I really like how discussions are oriented around pieces of content.  Each 
new article has an associated "forum".  That means it's easy to find discussion
about, say, a new computer game -- just look for articles about it, and read
their associated comments.
<P>
Also, the threaded and dthreaded viewing modes are pretty interesting.  Instead
of a flat format like most forum systems, in threaded mode each "main topic"
in a forum is displayed in fulltext, rather than just as a subject line.  Each 
reply to this main topic is displayed in a list below it, identified by its 
"subject" (in this case, just the first hundred or so characters of the post).
Clicking on one of these replies moves the reply up to the pane occupied by the
original "main topic".  This lets users easily navigate through thousands of
posts, when a "flat" display method (like photo.net) would become impossible
to make sense of.
<P>
Also, users have access to a powerful fulltext search of thousands of posts,
but they're limited to sixty searches per hour to prevent attacks on the site.
I think that's kinda neat.

The Q+A format is very appropriate for the purpose of the site.  Out of the 
threads I looked at, none seemed to have grown very unwieldy, and the answers
are very straightforward.  However, I have trouble considering it a 
"discussion", since it's obnoxiously hard to follow who's replying to whom 
unless you read and remember everything.  Fortunately, that doesn't seem to
be that big of an issue for this site.
<P>
I really like the ease of getting a list of posts by category.

<UL>

<LI>2
<LI>0
<LI>can't figure out how to do it
</UL>
<P>
The "last comment", which provides a timestamp and author for the last post in 
thread from the top-level view of all the threads, is a nice feature.  Combined
with the fact that threads that are replied to get "juggled" to the top of the
list, it's easy for me to know which threads I should come back and read if I'm
absent for a day or two.
<P>
Other than that, however, this is pretty much bottom-of-the-barrel for 
discussion forums as far as I'm concerned.

<FONT SIZE="4">Slashdot.org</FONT><BR>
<UL>
<LI>3
<LI>1
<LI>0-20, depending on if they're all replies to the main post and if they've been
  modded up or down
<LI>3
</UL>
<P>
I like how Slashdot uses a threaded view but ALSO displays the fulltext of 
messages that are sub-replies (ie deep in a thread) but have been modded up
(ie a lot of moderators thought it was a useful post).  Neat trick.
<P>
It's also very easy to change your viewing settings, as there's a bar with
dropdown menus to make such changes at the top of every thread.  Much better
than burying it in a couple layers of "options" menus, if making it available at
all.

<P>
"Sticky" messages that stay at the top of the thread list are a useful feature.
This way moderators can keep something like an FAQ at the top of the threads,
so newbies have an easily-accessible way of reading the rules.   However,
some forums on Anandtech have almost too many of these messages, driving real
content that repeat users come for below the fold.
<P>
Interesting or important threads can be given special icons next to their 
subject line by a moderator.  This makes it easy to identify must-read items
(like really hot deals in the hot deals forum).
