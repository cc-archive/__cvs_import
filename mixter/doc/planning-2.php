For information about music, producing music, and recording, libraries/bookstores will have lots of information. There have been a tremendous amount of books written about this sort of thing. Mixter can include some of this information as magnet content, although by no means all. Mixter's advantage is that it will be able to respond quickly to questions. Often times the information needed will be how to mix two songs together, or find an agent's phone number at a record label, are short questions which can be answered by either a) a link to some already existing website with that information, or b) a short answer (the phone number.) These questions are often easier to ask and have someone answer than to try to look on their own, so the Mixter user will have ready access to quick answers.

For actually getting free music - there aren't really any free, legal, offline alternatives, so Mixter has no offline competition in this respect.

For collaboration - If several musicians aren't seperated by time/space, it will still be much easier for them to get together in a sound studio and record with each other than to try to work through Mixter. However, if musicians can't physically meet, their offline alternative is to record tracks seperately, send them to each other, and maintain a number of concurrent sets of tapes of differnet song versions. They will have to mail/give these back and forth to each other, and there is a great potential for loss or damage, and the time costs are prohibitive. (Probably why this sort of thing doesn't happen now.) In these circumstances, Mixter provides a huge advantage.
