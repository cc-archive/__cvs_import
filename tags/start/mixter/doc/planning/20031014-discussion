<h1>Refinement Plan</h1>
Our refinement plan may seem rather short, although it should be noted that in the process of bringing our forum code up to our new, modular standards, there were enough changes that I basically just rewrote it from scratch, so a lot of the suggested changes from others in the class and the teaching staff were already made this last week as I rewrote the code. - Matt
<UL>
 <LI>Don't let users make posts if they aren't logged in. Instead of a login box. (Done!)
 <LI>Change the link labels for approving, rejecting forums, and deleting content to be more informative. (Modifications to the template files associated with forums, i.e. forum-answer.template, forum-question.template, etc)
 <LI>Make forum link on main page more noticeable. (welcome.template and home.template)
 <LI>After you login, add redirect to forum page. (change login-submit to use an HTTP_REFERER passed in if it is within the mixter domain)
 <LI>Include more of a description for "subject" and "body" of posts, that gives the user a better idea what goes in which field. (forum-create-post)
 <LI>Add administration options that allow more powerful administration, such as filtering new posts by users in the last week. (forums.template, forums.php, mod-content/new-forums.lib)
 <LI>Rearrange the user-registration page to make it flow better. (create-account.template)
